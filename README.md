# Task Management System

The **Task Management System** is a REST API developed using **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL**. It allows users to manage tasks with various CRUD operations and features authentication and authorization implemented with **JWT** and **bcrypt**.

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
- Marking tasks as finished or unfinished
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
1. Install and set up PostgreSQL on your machine.

### Installation Steps
1. Navigate to the project directory and locate the database setup file at:
   `task-mgmt/server/database.sql`
2. Run the commands in this file on your PostgreSQL shell to clone the database and seed it with dummy data.
3. Update the database pool configuration in the file:
   `task-mgmt/server/db.js`
   Modify it to match your PostgreSQL settings.
4. Set your environment variables by using the `.env.sample` file as a reference.
5. In your terminal, execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   - `npm install`: Installs all project dependencies.
   - `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.

6. The project should now be running on the port specified in your `.env` file.
7. You'll have to register and log in some dummy users to test the functionality!
